## IGM Ly-a Thermal Emulator Setup

This project is designed to set up and train a Neural Network (NN) emulator for the IGM Ly-a thermal parameter inference with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).

### Usage

Run the `lya_thermal_emulator_setup.py` script. This script will guide you through the process of setting up and training the emulator.

```bash
python3 lya_thermal_emulator_setup.py
